    "After identifying the advantages of using stochastic gradient descent over gradient descent, particularly when optimizing larger training sets, it is useful to shift focus to multi-layered perceptrons (MLP). This is where an analogy to biology proves quite useful; a single neuron on its own is quite futile, but a network of neurons (a network of hundreds of billions of neurons in the case of the human brain), can be extraordinarily powerful. In the context of machine learning, a single-layer perceptron with just 2 layers of nodes (inputs and outputs),  is only capable of learning linearly separable patterns, but when these layers are stacked, they can compute any function.\n",

    "An activation function is used to determine the output of the neural network; for example, a YES or a NO (a binary outcome). In this instance, it would be acceptable to use a step function - one that classifies your output as a 0 or a 1, based on your selected threshold. Itâ€™s value would be 1 (activated) when the value > threshold, and 0 (inactive) otherwise. However, this presents a problem when multiple neurons are activated, or when we move past evaluating binary options."
